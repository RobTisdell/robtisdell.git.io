					<p class="title">About Us</p>
					<p>FLAG is an organization and social group for leather and glove enthusiasts.  We hold events and social gatherings for our members and anyone curious or interested. Our members range in age from their twenties to their seventies. While FLAG's members are predominantly cisgender gay men, we do not limit our members to that category. We have straight members, trans members, women, and non-binary people as active part of our group, staff, and titleholders!  FLAG is an open organization to anyone who shares our love for leather and gloves.</p>
