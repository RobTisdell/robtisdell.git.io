					<p class="title">Join FLAG</p>
					<p>Interested in joining us?  We'd love to have you!  We recommend you read our bylaws and our mission statement before you join, just so you know what the club stands for first.  Once you've read those over, there are two ways to join.  The first is to print out <a href="files/FLAG_Application.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this form</a>, fill it out and bring it to an event (Along with dues).  We do have these forms available at our meetings if you would prefer to fill one out there as well.  The second is to fill out <a href="files/FLAG_Application_Digital.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this digitally fillable form</a>, and email it alongside dues with Paypal payment for dues.</p>
