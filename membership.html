		<p class="title">Join FLAG</p>
		<p>This is where we'd have information on how to become a FLAG member.  I really would not personally feel comfortable handling any payment processing here, though linking to a Paypal, Venmo, etc might be fine.  We'd have a link to the PDF application to join.  Ideally we can make it an editable PDF.</p>
