					<p class="title">FLAG History</p>
					<p>In 1988 our, founder, Jim Maciel saw a personal ad in Drummer Magazine mentioning gloves. Until this ad, Jim believed he was the only person with an interest in gloves. He answered the ad and received a letter from a gentleman named Pat Roche. He answerd Jim back and mentioned he had been in contact with others that shared a fetish for gloves. For the next three years, Jim and Pat talked about forming an organization around a glove fetish. The end result was Fits Like A Glove. FLAG was launched with a newsletter on June 19, 1991.</p>
					<p>In March of 1992, FLAG's colors and logo were finalized. Jim’s mother created the first banner that August. FLAG's first official in-person meeting was held December 19,1992 At Chuck Mattina’s House in Dorchester, Massachusetts. The future of FLAG was discussed and Jim, as President, appointed the first Board of Directors. Father James Collins became the first Vice President, Chuck Mattina became our first Secretary, and Jim Gardner became our first Parliamantarian.</p>
					<p>In 2003, FLAG started the Mr./Ms FLAG contest at the (now defunct) Boston Ramrod. The FLAG Contest was started August 2003 in Boston and we now proudly host the contest here at the Providence Eagle. In 2013, FLAG moved our home bar from the Ramrod to the Providence Eagle. In 2015, FLAG added the Q title as an option for those who identify as queer, questioning, or non-binary. And in 2024 we added the Mx title for those who are queer or nonbinary and prefer the Mx. We are proud to include all members of the fetish community in our contest and to be a part of Fits Like A Glove.</p>
					<p>FLAG has been hosting events in the New England area for 34 years. We have hosted events in Connecticut, New York State, Washington DC, San Francisco, Chicago, Europe, Massachusetts and of course Rhode Island at our home bar,The Providence Eagle.</p>
