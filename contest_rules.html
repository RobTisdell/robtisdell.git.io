		<p class="title">Winning the FLAG Contest &AMP Titleholder Expectations</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The winner will receive a FLAG back patch, become a lifetime member to Fits Like A Glove, a pair of gloves, a FLAG T-shirt, and $100 cash.</li>
				<li>The winner will also receive the Mr/Ms/Mx/Q FLAG sash to use for their title year.
				<br>
				<i>(Please note: The sash is not the winner's to keep after their title year. It must be returned when they step down, and is to be presented to the following year’s winner. The sash is expected to be kept in great condition by each titleholder. It is the titleholder's responsibility to replace it if it is lost or damaged.)</i>
				</li>
				<li>As a representative of FLAG, the contest winner is expected to participate in all FLAG-related events from from the start of their title year through the end of the next contest. Titleholders are expected to be present and march in Boston Pride, and <i>required</i> to march in Providence Pride Parade.  Titleholders are expected to be a judge for and step down at the next contest. During their title years, Titleholders are expected to do one fund raising event to help raise money for a charity of their choice, as well as one fundraising event for FLAG. The charity must be approved by the FLAG board.</li>
				<li>The winner of the FLAG contest is not permitted to compete at another local leather contest until after their title year expires.
				<br>
				<i>(Note: The current title holder may, with the FLAG board approval, compete for a regional, national or international title during their title year.)</i></li>
				<li>If approved for a regional, national or international competition, FLAG will do what we can to support you. FLAG may be willing to sponsor you and pay sponsor fees, if any, and if the funds are available.
				<br><i>(Please note that we can not cover hotel or travel expenses)</i></li>
				<li>FLAG requests that the winner of the FLAG Contest conduct themselves in an appropriate and respectful manner when wearing the back patch and/or sas, and representing the FLAG title. FLAG is a community-based organization and the title holder must represent FLAG as such. If the title holder wants to participate in any political rallies and events, they must do it as themselves and not as a representative of FLAG and its members. This includes any postings on social media and any interviews, media coverage, whether it be digital or print.</li>
